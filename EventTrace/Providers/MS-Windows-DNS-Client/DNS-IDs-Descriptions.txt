      To correct the problem, you may restart the RPC and DNS Client services. To do so, use the following commands at 
      a command prompt: (1) type 'net start rpc' to start the RPC service, and (2) type 'net start dnscache' to start  
      the DNS Client service. See event details for specific error code information.

      The cause of this DNS registration failure was because the DNS update request timed out after being sent to the

      running.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                       
      You can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at 
      the command prompt. If problems still  persist, contact your network systems administrator to verify network     
      conditions.

      The cause of this DNS registration failure was because of DNS server failure. This may be due to a zone transfer 
      that has locked the DNS server for the applicable zone that your computer needs to register itself with.         
                                                                                                                       
      (The applicable zone should typically correspond to the Adapter-specific Domain Suffix that was indicated        
      above.) You can manually retry registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig          
      /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your network systems administrator to    
      verify network conditions.

      The reason it could not register was because either: (a) the DNS server does not support the DNS dynamic update  
      protocol, or (b) the primary zone authoritative for the registering names does not currently accept dynamic      
      updates.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                       
      To add or register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS name for this adapter, contact

      The reason it could not register was because the DNS server refused the dynamic update request. This could       
      happen for the following reasons: (a) current DNS update policies do not allow this computer to update the DNS   
      domain name configured for this adapter, or (b) the authoritative DNS server for this DNS domain name does not   
      support the DNS dynamic update protocol.                                                                         
                                                                                                                       
      To register a DNS host (A or AAAA) resource record using the specific DNS domain name for this adapter, contact  
      your DNS server or network systems administrator.

      The system could not register the DNS update request because of a security related problem. This could happen    
      for the following reasons: (a) the DNS domain name that your computer is trying to register could not be updated 
      because your computer does not have the right permissions, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating    
      valid credentials with the DNS server to update.

      The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because the update request that was sent to the      
      specified DNS server timed out. This is probably because the authoritative DNS server for the name being         
      registered is not running.

      The cause was DNS server failure. This may be because the reverse lookup zone is busy or missing on the DNS      
      server that your computer needs to update. In most cases, this is a minor problem because it does not affect     
      normal (forward) name resolution.                                                                                
                                                                                                                       
      If reverse (address-to-name) resolution is required for your computer, you can manually retry DNS registration   
      of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems     
      still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator. See event details for specific error    
      code information.

      The reason that the system could not register these RRs was because (a) either the DNS server does not support   
      the DNS dynamic update protocol, or (b) the authoritative zone where these records are to be registered does not 
      allow dynamic updates.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                       
      To register DNS pointer (PTR) resource records using the specific DNS domain name and IP addresses for this      
      adapter, contact your DNS server or network systems administrator.

      (b) because the DNS server authoritative for the specified name does not support the DNS dynamic update protocol.

      The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the update request it sent to the DNS server      
      timed out. The most likely cause of this is that the DNS server authoritative for the name it was attempting to  
      register or update is not running at this time.                                                                  
                                                                                                                       
      You can manually retry DNS registration of the network adapter and its settings by typing 'ipconfig              
      /registerdns' at the command prompt. If problems still persist, contact your DNS server or network systems       
      administrator.

      The reason the system could not register these RRs was because the DNS server failed the update request. The

      The reason for this failure is because the DNS server it sent the update request to timed out. The most likely   
      cause of this failure is that the DNS server authoritative for the zone where the registration was originally    
      made is either not running or unreachable through the network at this time.

      The reason for this failure is because the DNS server it sent the update to failed the update request. A         
      possible cause of this failure is that the DNS server required to process this update request has a lock in      
      place on the zone, probably because a zone transfer is in progress.

      The reason the system could not perform the update request was the DNS server contacted refused update request.  
      The cause of this is (a) this computer is not allowed to update the specified DNS domain name, or (b) because    
      the DNS server authoritative for the zone that requires updating does not support the DNS dynamic update         
      protocol.

      The reason the system could not perform the update request was because of a security related problem. The cause  
      of this could be (a) your computer does not have permissions to register and update the specific DNS domain name 
      set for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server   
      during the processing of the update request.

      The system could not remove these PTR RRs because the update request timed out while awaiting a response from

      The system could not remove these PTR RRs because the DNS server failed the update request. A possible cause is

      The system could not remove these PTR RRs because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be that 
      (a) your computer does not have permissions to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses    
      configured for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS   
      server during the processing of the update request. See event details for specific error code information.

      The request to remove these records failed because the DNS server refused the update request. The cause of this  
      might be that either (a) this computer is not allowed to update the DNS domain name specified by these settings, 
      or (b) because the DNS server authorized to perform updates for the zone that contains these RRs does not        
      support the DNS dynamic update protocol.

      The reason for this failure was because of a security related problem. The cause of this could be that (a) your  
      computer does not have permissions to remove and update the specific DNS domain name or IP addresses configured  
      for this adapter, or (b) there might have been a problem negotiating valid credentials with the DNS server       
      during the processing of the update request. See event details for specific error code information.
